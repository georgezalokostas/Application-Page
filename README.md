# ApplicationPage
You work for a company that has tripled in size over the past few years and the way
the vacation process works is no longer efficient, as it requires a combination of hand
written applications, approvals, storage and maintenance. I am asked to create a
portal where employees can request their vacation online, the manager receives a
notification to approve or decline that request, and the information (time used,
balances) are stored within the portal.

When you're logged in as an employee, the user can see the list of his past applications.
He can create a new application through a form that gets set to pending while
the manager gets a notification through his email. He then can accept or decline it
and it gets refreshed on the user's list.

When you're logged in as an admin, the admin can see a complete list of the employees,
their name and their email. He can create a new employee or an admin through a form,
or he can update existing employees.
