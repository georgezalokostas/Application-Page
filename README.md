# ApplicationPage
You work for a company that has tripled in size over the past few years and the way
the vacation process works is no longer efficient, as it requires a combination of hand
written applications, approvals, storage and maintenance. I am asked to create a
portal where employees can request their vacation online, the manager receives a
notification to approve or decline that request, and the information (time used,
balances) are stored within the portal.
